He has a lot of talents, including sketching, painting, sculpture, and literature. His first poem was written when he was 8 years old. He used to study at Biñan Laguna, Ateneo Municipal, and the University of Sto. Tomas.

              <h1>Journey</h1> <br><br>
              <p>Dr. Jose Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, had a remarkable journey throughout his life. He was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, and grew up in a loving and educated family. Rizal's thirst for knowledge led him to pursue higher education in Manila, Spain, Germany, and France.

                During his time abroad, Rizal immersed himself in various fields of study, including medicine, literature, and the sciences. He became fluent in several languages and developed a deep understanding of different cultures and societies. Rizal's experiences abroad greatly influenced his perspective on colonialism and social injustice, which would later shape his advocacy for Philippine independence.
                
                Rizal's most notable work, "Noli Me Tangere" (Touch Me Not), exposed the harsh realities of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. This novel sparked a sense of national consciousness among Filipinos and ignited the flames of revolution against Spanish oppression.
                
                Upon returning to the Philippines, Rizal continued to fight for reforms and equality through his writings and peaceful activism. However, his efforts were met with resistance from the Spanish authorities. In 1896, Rizal was unjustly accused of rebellion and sentenced to death by firing squad.
                
                Despite his tragic end, Rizal's legacy lives on as a symbol of courage, patriotism, and intellectual brilliance. His writings and ideals continue to inspire generations of Filipinos to strive for freedom, justice, and national pride.</p>
